# Data2040-midterm-project

This project is a Kaggle competition of Bengali AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification in deep learning. The goal of the project is improving language recognition by constructing appropriate CNN models given the dataset of Bengali. The project has been divided into several sections, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model construction, model improvements, and results analysis. We started with a baseline model and strived for improving accuracy of the classification, which reached over 97% in the end.
